some guide and codes(in a later date) for processing household registration (戶籍) population in Taiwan

In Taiwan, there are two kinds of national population statistics: household registration (戶籍) and business & Industrial census (工商普查). The former reflects the number of residents across Taiwan, tabulating data from local magistrates. On the other hand, the B&I census recorded the demography of employees and their employers. One might notice I use different tenses for them. That's because household registration is updated for each month. B&I is conducted every five years, and generally published 1-2 years later. Having monthly data may sound good, however, one must consider if such frequency fits their purpose. Furthermore, the MOI and local magistrates don’t require residents to update their residency whenever they move. It’s not uncommon for people to keep their old residency to maintain some perks or benefits provided by the local government.
The household registration is kept by the Ministry of Interior (B&I by BGBAS). Its public records contain the number of residents and households, gender and age distribution and most importantly, the aggregate entity the statistics belong to. The smallest aggregate level is 村/里(chun/li, 'village/community'), practically the third level of Taiwanese governing and statistics level. Average population for each village is a few thousands people, while much larger ones exist. Working on a village dataset comes with the benefit of connecting to its GIS data like boundary or area. This expands research scope into spatial relationships, allowing this demographic information to be attached to any point datasets. Once you establish this spatial relationship, there is more than finding out which store is at which village. For example, you will be able to create central places through Voronoi’s diagram that gives a more precise picture of stores’ customer exposure. 
That is, you know how to connect all sorts of data through their attributes. This is mostly achieved through matching the code and the name from files of interest. Most villages will be merged without trouble based on either information. But failed merges and, more importantly, false merges take time to be cleaned. Naming and coding methods are different for various types of administrations and, bizarrely, government departments.
As a researcher, your greatest enemy in collecting Taiwanese population is its government. First, as many other places, the Taiwanese government has constrained creativity in terms of naming places. Future analysts are advised not to rely on names if possible. The second issue comes from the special municipalities that were formerly provincial cities. When a new special municipality is created, two things happen: either a city/county is upgraded by itself, or two neighboring administrations are merged and upgraded. Both situations lead to a new city code. Whenever the island restructured its local system, it decided to redo its code book as well. Spoil Alert: THEY DON'T KEEP RECORD. The advised course would be establishing your own record for such changes, figuring out if they led to any change in code or name, and adding clauses in your code to address them.
Alas, the household registration has one final trick awaiting us. Its most essential information, the village boundary, is rather fluid. There is no fixed rule on its redrawing, which fully depends on local councils. If your research focuses on an earlier period, then there is no escape from this problem. If not, and the scope is limited to one or few local entities, some of the local government, not MOI, do keep various versions of village boundaries reflecting these changes. Indeed, a cross-entity analysis would require merging these different GIS files. But if you have the will to go through multiple local bureaucracy, why not take one more step to learn some GIS skills?
